## Description
The desert protected by the Magical Mayhem is under attack! Only you, the true hero of the whipping sands, can lead the Magical Mayhem to victory!
 My project is a simple reconstruction of Space Invaders. The goal of the game is simple- destroy as many enemies as you can before the buggies of the sands catch you! 
 In all honesty, this project was going to be something completely different. I had wanted to make a creature that gave you art advice, but I felt bored with the concept and realized I did want to try my hand at remaking my favorite games: Space Invaders!
  This project was probably the hardest thing I have done in a long time, and I'm happy that it came together the way it did. Going through all my directories really taught me how to organize my code and improve it in the future! My repository has several classes that I used for the functionality of the game, including the way that the bullets behave, the way that the bugs move from one side of the screen to the other, and the settings for how the game looks to the viewer. 
  There are some small parts that I do think I could improve on. I wanted the background to be cooler than it was, and I feel as though the speed of the bullets could be a little slower. These are all easy things to fix, but I think the biggest thing was just trying to debug the code. Debugging the code took a long time and it taught me I should really do each part by itself, then figure out what's wrong with it as I go. 
 Overall, I'm proud of this project even if it is a little simple, because this was so far outside my scope of knowledge.
